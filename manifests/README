= Manifest Directory =

Place all of your site manifests here.

The 'import' statement has been deprecated, and the directory inclusion using
the 'manifest' option in puppet.conf does not recurse so any node delcarations
will need to be placed in files in this directory.

Be careful since all code placed in this directory will be directly included
into ALL nodes unless scoped.
