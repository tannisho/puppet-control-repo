# This is an example hostgroup hiera file for hosts in the 'gitlab' hostgroup.
# Any parameters added here will be applied to every system as defined by the
# hostgroup variable.
#
# See `manifests/site.pp` for an example use case for the hostgroup variable.
#
# This is the place to include classes or configuration that is specific to
# nodes in this group. For example, to manage gitlab on these machines:
#
# ```
# simp::classes:
#   - simp_gitlab
#
# simp_gitlab::gitlab_options:
#   user:
#     username: testuser
#     group: testgroup
# ```
#
#
# Hiera crashes if there are empty files, so
# please remove the following line if you use this file
this_is_another_example_key: 'that does nothing'
